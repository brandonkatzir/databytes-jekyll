# Welcome to the Markdown Workshop

We'll be looking at Markdown generally and exploring how to use it in the Jekyll sites we created last time. 

Let's take a look at some basic syntax like ordered lists. 

Ordered lists are created simply by using numerals: 
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

Unordered lists are created using a hyphen
- Item
- Other item
    - Indenting and using a hyphen creates a nested list

Markdown is also used in a lot of documentation. One of the reasons for that is the ease of formatting code. For example, we use the following code to launch Jekyll: 

```bundle exec jekyll serve --watch```

Block paragraphs are also important
> They give us more information about a topic. 

We can also *emphasize* or **go bold** or even ***really emphasize*** when we want to! 

You can also render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$
