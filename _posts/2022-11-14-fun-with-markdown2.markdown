# Welcome to the Markdown Workshop

We'll be looking at [our GitHub Pages site](https://brandonkatzir.github.io/KatzirDemo2). 

We need to have the following: 
1. blah
2. blahblah
3. blahblahblah

And also
* something
* something something

We use the following code to launch Jekyll 

```bundle exec jekyll serve --watch```

Block paragraphs are important
> They tell us what we need to know. 

We can also *emphasize* or **go bold** or even ***really emphasize*** when we want to!
